Borrelia burgdorferi, an emerging bacterial pathogen, is maintained in nature by transmission from one vertebrate
host to another by ticks. 
The genome of B. burgdorferi has been sequenced (Fraser et al. 1997; Casjens et al. 2000) and shown to
comprise a linear chromosome of 0.91 Mb and at least 21 linear and circular plasmids with combined size of 0.5 Mb.
One ofthe few antigens against which mammals develop protective immunity is the highly polymorphic
OspC protein, encoded by the ospC gene on the cp26 plasmid.
